# Book Review Website Documentation

# Overview:
The Book Review website enables users to interact with a database containing details of books they've read or plan to read. The website provides functionalities to manipulate book data while ensuring that certain features, like editing and deletion, are restricted to authorized users.

# Features:
# Book Database:

Stores comprehensive details of books, including title, author, genre, review, and cover images fetched from OpenLibrary.org.

# User Interactions:
# Read:
Users can browse through the collection of books and view their details.
# Sorting:
By Recency: Implement a sorting option that displays books based on their publication date or the date they were added to the database, showing the most recent ones first.
By Rating: Enable a sorting mechanism that arranges books according to user ratings, showcasing the highest-rated books at the top of the list.
# Add:
Authorized users can add new books to the database, including relevant information and cover images.
# Admin Privileges:
Edit and Delete: Restricted features that are accessible only to authorized administrators for modifying or removing book details.
Integration with OpenLibrary.org:

Book cover images are fetched and stored from OpenLibrary.org, enhancing the visual representation of the books within the website, providing users with a richer browsing experience.

# Struggles and Learning:

During the last module, the focus shifted towards understanding and implementing RESTful APIs. The challenges and learning experiences encountered during this phase included:

# API Integration: 
Understanding how to fetch data from APIs, utilize Axios for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
# Building Own API:
Creation of a custom API to handle book-related data, managing endpoints and data interaction.
# Database Implementation with PostgreSQL: 
Configuring and utilizing PostgreSQL for storing book details, along with learning CRUD operations specific to databases.
# Discussion and Learning:
Despite the difficulties, engaging in discussions among fellow students facilitated a clearer understanding of the concepts. Collaborative learning helped in resolving doubts and solidifying comprehension.
# Conclusion:
The completion of the database section, combined with the REST API module, marks a significant milestone in the development of the Book Review website. The struggles encountered were overcome through dedication, collaborative learning, and mentorship, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of database management and API integration within web development.
