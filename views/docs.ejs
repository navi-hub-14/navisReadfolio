        <h1 class="heading">Book Review Website Documentation</h1>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong>
        <p>Welcome to the documentation section of the Book Review website, a project completed as part of the Udemy Web
            Development Bootcamp led by Angela Yu. This challenge focused on creating a database-driven website to
            manage and review books, allowing users to read, add, edit, and delete book details.
        </p>
        <strong>Overview:</strong>
        <p>The Book Review website enables users to interact with a database containing details of books they've read or
            plan to read. The website provides functionalities to manipulate book data while ensuring that certain
            features, like editing and deletion, are restricted to authorized users.
        </p>
        <strong>Features:</strong>
        <p><span>Book Database: </span>
            <p>
                Stores comprehensive details of books, including title, author, genre, review,
            and cover images fetched from OpenLibrary.org.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <span>User Interactions:</span>
        <ol>
            <li>Read:
                <ul>
                    <li> Users can browse through the collection of books and view their details.</li>
                    <li> Sorting:
                        <ul>
                            <li>By Recency: Implement a sorting option that displays books based on their publication
                                date or the date they were added to the database, showing the most recent ones first.
                            </li>
                            <li> By Rating: Enable a sorting mechanism that arranges books according to user ratings,
                                showcasing the highest-rated books at the top of the list.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Add:
                <ul>
                    <li>Authorized users can add new books to the database, including relevant information and cover
                        images.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Admin Privileges:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Edit and Delete: Restricted features that are accessible only to authorized administrators for modifying or removing book details.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <span>Integration with OpenLibrary.org:</span>
        <p>
            Book cover images are fetched and stored from <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">OpenLibrary.org</a>, enhancing the visual representation of the
            books within the website, providing users with a richer browsing experience.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Struggles and Learning: </span>
        <p>
            During the last module, the focus shifted towards understanding and implementing RESTful APIs. The
            challenges and learning experiences encountered during this phase included:
        </p>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>API Integration: </span>Understanding how to fetch data from APIs, utilize Axios for CRUD (Create,
                Read, Update, Delete) operations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Building Own API: </span>Creation of a custom API to handle book-related data, managing endpoints
                and data interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Database Implementation with PostgreSQL: </span>Configuring and utilizing PostgreSQL for storing
                book details, along
                with learning CRUD operations specific to databases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Discussion and Learning: </span>Despite the difficulties, engaging in discussions among fellow
                students facilitated a
                clearer understanding of the concepts. Collaborative learning helped in resolving doubts and solidifying
                comprehension.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Conclusion: </strong>
        <p>
            The completion of the database section, combined with the REST API module, marks a significant milestone in
            the development of the Book Review website. The struggles encountered were overcome through dedication,
            collaborative learning, and mentorship, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of database management
            and API integration within web development.
